    "An open-source library, created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant [2], it has become the de facto standard for working with numerical data in Python, and is used by everyone from beginners to experienced researchers at the cutting edge of scientific and commercial R&D [3]. Additionally, several other Python analytical libraries have been built on top of NumPy, including Pandas, Scikit-learn and Matplotlib [1]. \n",

Ndarrys are homogeneous, meaning that all data stored within the array must be of the same type. Each array has a shape, which is a tuple that indicates the nu\n",
